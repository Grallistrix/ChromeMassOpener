# ChromeMassOpener
## What is it?
I needed a quick and easy way to open multiple websites at once, so I created this simple tool to address that need. This tool reads a specified file containing a list of URLs and opens them all in the Google Chrome browser.

## Features

- Open multiple websites simultaneously in Chrome.
- Configuration through a file with a list of URLs.

## URLs File Formatting
For the program to work, you need to format your file by separating your links, each into new line
```
www.ExampleSite.com
www.ExampleSite2.com
www.ExampleSite3.com
```

## System Requirements
- Windows, no other OS supported
- Google Chrome browser installed.
